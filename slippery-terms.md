# 🧊 Slippery Terms in Software

Some words in tech sound precise but aren’t. They’re overloaded, fuzzy, or mean different things in different roles or contexts. These “slippery terms” can mislead, confuse, or mask complexity.

This article rounds up a dozen of them and explains how to clarify what someone really means.

## 🧠 Why These Terms Matter

Slippery terms create friction in interviews, design reviews, planning meetings, and even team chats.

They’re not bad — but they need anchoring.

If you hear one, your job isn’t to argue. It’s to ask: “Can you give an example of what you mean?”

|---------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Reactive      | State updates? Streams? Spreadsheet-like?       | Varies across frameworks and paradigms            |
| Responsive    | Layout? Input latency? Data freshness?           | UX vs CSS vs app sync                             |
| Component     | React/Vue unit? Web Component? Design token?     | Different concepts in UI and systems              |
| Declarative   | JSX? SQL? Terraform?                            | Often used aspirationally                         |
| Modular       | Reusable? Swappable? Organized in folders?      | Implies structure without specifics               |
| Static        | Prebuilt? Immutable? Content-only?              | SSG vs SSR vs code analysis meanings              |
| Dynamic       | Client-rendered? Server-run? Recomputed?        | Often “not static” without clarity                |
| State         | UI data? Server cache? Session context?         | Overloaded across layers                          |
| Performance   | Load time? Input latency? Backend QPS?          | Lacks scope without metrics                       |
| Lightweight   | Few KB? Few concepts? Few dependencies?         | Relative term with no anchor                      |
| Responsive    | UX latency? CSS behavior? Reactive data?        | Triply ambiguous across fields                    |

## 💬 How to Clarify in Conversation

- “When you say ‘X’, do you mean more like ___ or ___?”
- “Can you show me what that would look like?”
- “In our stack, does that refer to ___?”

Being curious ≠ being pedantic. It shows you want to align.

## 📣 Takeaway

Slippery terms aren’t wrong — they’re clues. They tell you a topic matters, but not exactly how.

Use them as starting points for better questions, not conclusions.
