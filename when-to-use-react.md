# ‚öõÔ∏è When to Use React (and When Not To)

React is one of the most popular UI frameworks of the past decade ‚Äî but it‚Äôs not always the right tool for the job. Its strengths shine in certain scenarios, and its complexity can be overkill in others.

This article helps you decide when React fits, and when something simpler or more specialized might serve you better.

## ‚úÖ When React Shines

| Scenario                                 | Why React Helps                          |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Dynamic UIs with lots of interactivity   | Component re-renders are clean and scoped |
| App-like experiences                     | SPA routing, state management, context    |
| Shared UI logic across many views        | Hooks and custom components               |
| Component libraries or design systems    | Reusable patterns, prop-driven APIs       |
| Developer onboarding on large teams      | Familiarity and community support         |

React brings structure and mental models that scale with team size and app scope.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When React Might Be Overkill

| Scenario                           | Lighter Tools May Fit Better               |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Static marketing pages             | Astro, Eleventy, plain HTML                |
| Minor interactivity                | HTMX, Alpine.js, Stimulus                  |
| Server-heavy apps (Rails, Django) | Server-rendered templates with sprinkles   |
| Small projects with one developer | Less boilerplate = faster iteration        |
| Rapid prototyping                  | Svelte, Vue, plain JS + HTML               |

React adds a lot of indirection. For simple flows, that can be friction.

## üß† What Does ‚ÄúUsing React‚Äù Really Mean?

- Bundling and transpiling JSX
- Embracing a component-first structure
- Managing state with hooks or libraries
- Navigating app flow via client-side routing
- Installing a runtime + ecosystem of tools

You‚Äôre not just picking a syntax ‚Äî you‚Äôre picking an architecture.

## üß™ Cost of Abstraction

React encourages abstraction:

- Components
- Hooks
- Contexts
- Render props

These are great for DRY code and scaling ‚Äî but can obscure flow, especially for new team members.

---

## üß∞ When in Doubt, Start Small

- Use HTML + JS for static pages or tiny tools
- Reach for HTMX when you want interactivity without the JavaScript burden
- Use React if you‚Äôre building a complex, stateful UI ‚Äî and want to invest in long-term maintainability

## üì£ Takeaway

React is powerful ‚Äî but not always necessary. Know its strengths, recognize its cost, and use it when the project, team, and timeline truly benefit.

Right tool, right job, right time.
