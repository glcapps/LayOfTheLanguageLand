🎓 Languages, Layers, and Leverage  
Navigating Code, Communication, Interviews, and Career Conversations

## 🧭 Purpose

This project explores the evolving terrain of programming languages — not just their syntax, but their implied workflows, idioms, and roles in team and business dynamics. It aims to decode how languages influence:

- Collaboration habits and onboarding curves
- Developer interview framing and career signals
- Technical vs non-technical stakeholder conversations
- Ecosystem expectations and unspoken assumptions

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Slippery terms like “reactive,” “responsive,” “component,” and “state”
- Logic/data separation philosophies in frameworks and languages
- JSX, templating, and Web Components as boundary-setting technologies
- When React, Vue, HTMX, or Svelte make sense — and for whom
- Programming idioms as signals in hiring and collaboration
- What “modular,” “lightweight,” “declarative,” or “scalable” really mean
- Auxiliary languages and config syntaxes (SQL, Bash, Dockerfile, Terraform, etc.)
- Building interactive maps of language roles and idioms

## 💡 Audience

This repo is for:

- Developers preparing for interviews or career pivots
- Engineers evaluating language choices with long-term impact
- Teams clarifying stack decisions and expectations
- Technical educators or mentors translating between paradigms
- Anyone trying to explain or defend their tooling to non-devs
