# üßæ Declarative vs Imperative

One of the most foundational distinctions in programming style is between declarative and imperative paradigms ‚Äî yet the line between them is often blurry, especially in modern frontend tools. This article explores how they differ, how they mix, and what that means in practice.

## üß† Core Distinction

| Imperative                        | Declarative                            |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| You specify how to do it         | You specify what you want              |
| Step-by-step instructions        | Desired end state                      |
| Mutates state as it progresses   | Often uses immutable descriptions      |
| More control                     | More abstraction                       |

Example:

Imperative:
```js
const result = [];
for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
  if (nums[i] % 2 === 0) result.push(nums[i] * 2);
}
```

Declarative:
```js
const result = nums.filter(n => n % 2 === 0).map(n => n * 2);
```

## üß∞ Tools and Frameworks: Where It Shows Up

| Tool / Feature         | Imperative Style Example             | Declarative Style Example                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| DOM Manipulation       | `document.createElement()`           | JSX / template rendering                  |
| UI Animation           | `setInterval`, manual style updates  | CSS transitions, Framer Motion            |
| Routing                | Manual `window.location` change      | Declarative route trees                   |
| State Updates          | `count++` in a handler               | `setCount(n => n + 1)`                    |

## üß¨ React as a Case Study

React claims to be declarative: ‚ÄúYou describe what the UI should look like for a given state.‚Äù

But in practice:

- You still write `useEffect()` imperatively to perform side effects
- JSX may look declarative but is compiled into imperative React calls
- State updates are abstracted, but async behavior and batching are deeply imperative under the hood

So it‚Äôs more accurate to say:

> React encourages declarative descriptions, but requires imperative escapes.

## üß† Why It Matters

- Declarative code tends to be more concise and composable
- Imperative code gives you precision and often better performance
- Teams should agree on where to lean into abstraction and where to be explicit

## ‚öñÔ∏è How to Choose

| If you want...                      | Prefer...       |
|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Readability and intent clarity     | Declarative     |
| Fine-grained performance tuning    | Imperative      |
| Rapid development with guardrails  | Declarative     |
| Full control over flow and timing  | Imperative      |

Often, the best solutions blend both ‚Äî but knowing where your tool falls on the spectrum helps you reason about it better.

## üß© Takeaway

Declarative and imperative aren't binary categories ‚Äî they're a spectrum. Most tools mix both. The key is to understand the tradeoffs and make them visible to your team and to your future self.
