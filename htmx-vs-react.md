# 🔁 HTMX vs React

HTMX and React represent two very different philosophies about building interactive web interfaces. Both are powerful. Both can scale. But they make different bets about where complexity should live and who should manage it.

This article compares their mental models, tradeoffs, and sweet spots.

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

|                 | React                               | HTMX                                |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Primary language| JavaScript                          | HTML                                 |
| App structure   | Components + hooks                  | Enhanced HTML with attributes        |
| Interactivity   | Handled on client                   | Server responds to events            |
| State location  | In-memory on client                 | On server (or derived on request)    |
| Default model   | SPA (Single Page App)               | MPA (Multi Page, but seamless)       |

React wants you to build apps. HTMX wants you to build HTML that reacts to the server.

## ⚖️ Developer Experience

React requires:

- A build toolchain (e.g. Vite, Webpack)
- Familiarity with JSX, hooks, and often state management tools
- Strong JavaScript knowledge

HTMX requires:

- HTML
- A backend that can respond to POST/GET with HTML fragments
- No frontend build system

This means HTMX often feels like less setup and more flow — especially for developers from a server-rendered background.

## ⚡ Performance and Complexity

| Concern         | React                                | HTMX                                 |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| JS Bundle Size | Usually large (unless optimized)      | Tiny footprint                       |
| Interactivity  | Very fast once loaded                 | Fast by skipping JS altogether       |
| Tooling        | Mature, but heavyweight               | Lightweight, minimal                 |
| Debugging      | Complex state flow, devtools needed   | View source and network tab often enough |

HTMX is simpler to debug — you see what’s sent and what comes back. React requires navigating internal component trees and effects.

## 🧩 Use Cases

| Best For…                          | React                                   | HTMX                                  |
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Complex UIs, stateful interactions| ✅ Yes                                  | 🚫 Challenging without JS helpers      |
| Server-rendered content           | 🚫 Needs SSR setup                      | ✅ Built for it                         |
| Team-based apps with designers    | ✅ Works with design systems            | 🟡 Possible, less tooling support      |
| Admin panels, CRUD apps           | ✅ Excellent                            | ✅ Also excellent                      |
| Embeddable widgets or partials    | 🟡 Possible, but verbose                | ✅ Very clean                          |
| Rapid prototyping                 | 🚫 Needs setup                          | ✅ Copy-paste-friendly                 |

## 🤔 When to Choose HTMX

- You already have a server-rendered app
- You want to add dynamic behavior incrementally
- You prefer fewer tools and faster debugging
- You want to avoid hydration overhead

---

## 🤔 When to Choose React

- You’re building a complex interactive app from scratch
- You need local state, routing, and advanced UI logic
- You benefit from a rich component ecosystem
- You have multiple developers maintaining a frontend codebase

## 🧠 Closing Thought

HTMX and React are not enemies — they’re different tools with different philosophies. HTMX brings the power of interactivity back to HTML. React brings the power of abstraction to JavaScript.

If you’re building a product — not just a website — React may be the right bet.  
If you’re enhancing an existing product — or prioritizing simplicity — HTMX might win.

Both serve the same user. They just ask different things from the developer.
